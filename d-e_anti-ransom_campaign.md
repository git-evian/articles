# Dutch Police and Europol launches anti-ransom campaign

Dutch police and Europol have teamed up with the security companies Intel Security and Kaspersky Lab to create No More Ransom, a web-portal containing information on how to prevent such attacks, as well as tools that help users remove ransomware without paying off their attackers.

Ransomware is an attack carried out by installed malware that encrypts the victims files by locking the files hostage behind an encrypted paywall and thus making the files inaccessible to the legitimate user. This kind of attack exploits one of the most vulnerable security systems: humans. It is usually delivered via email attachment which once opened, releases the malware into the user’s system. This infection is silent, and not immediately apparent to the user until the system or data-locking mechanism is deployed. Once deployed it encrypts the files and generally a dialogue box appears telling that the user data has been locked and demanding a payment to a ransom to unlock. Even though it is not recommended to pay the ransom, mainly because it doesn’t guarantee a solution to the problem, a number of institutions have fallen victims of this kind of attack and have payed huge amounts to cyber-criminals in the hopes of recovering previous data. Ransomware is therefore one of the most threatening types of malware floating on the internet today.
